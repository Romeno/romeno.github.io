        Suceava is a city in northeastern Romania, located in the historical
        region of Bukovina. It was the capital of the Principality of Moldavia
        between 1388 and 1565. Today, it's an important cultural and historical
        center, known for landmarks like the Suceava Fortress and nearby painted
        monasteries, which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city also serves
        as a gateway to the scenic landscapes of the Carpathian Mountains.
        Suceava has a mix of historical architecture and modern development,
        reflecting its long-standing significance in Romanian history.
